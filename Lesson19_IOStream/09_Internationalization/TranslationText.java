/* TranslationText
 * Serializable representation of the data file. Has the serialVersionUID of 19L.
 * Member data names should be based on those implied by the getters. Member data are not final.
 * TIP: When serializing, you are effectively preserving the class structure as well as the
 * values the object holds. For this reason, member data must be identical to what is expected,
 * even if the variables are private. You should have only four variables (two arrays, a String,
 * and your serialVersionUID), with the names implied by the standard getter methods. Your months
 * and days array must be fixed length, 12 and 31 respectively.
 *
 * To check that your serialized version is identical, generate es-BO.ser from the es-BO.txt file and 
 * compare to the provided es-BO.ser.
